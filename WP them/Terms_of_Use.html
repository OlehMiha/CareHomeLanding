<h6>Limitation of Liability</h6>
14.1 The Software is intended to make it convenient and easier to manage staff and business operations. However, the Software is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including but not limited to, any implied warranties and merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. For the avoidance of doubt, MOBU Technologies does not warrant – and this is acknowledged by Customer – that (a) operation of the Software and supply of Services shall be uninterrupted or error free, or (b) that functions contained in the Software will be able to operate in combination with other software and systems used by Customer or meet Customer’s requirements.
14.2 Customer accepts that any information provided by MOBU Technologies is general information only and is not to be deemed as advice. MOBU Technologies will use reasonable business efforts to ensure that any information provided by MOBU Technologies is accurate. However, MOBU Technologies does not accept responsibility for any loss suffered as a result of Customer’s use of or reliance on the information provided by MOBU Technologies, other than expressly set out in the Contract.
14.3 MOBU Technologies shall in no event be liable to the Customer (or any other person or entity) for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute Software or product(s); loss of use, revenues, anticipated profits, anticipated savings, goodwill, business opportunities and/or any damage to and/or loss of data (in each case, whether direct or indirect or suffered by End Users); or business interruption) however caused and on any basis of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, misrepresentation, restitution or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of this Contract, the Software and Services, including Customer’s use thereof, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.
14.4 The total liability of MOBU Technologies for claims arising under or related to the Contract, tort, misrepresentation, restitution etc., howsoever arising, shall be limited to an amount equal to 50% of the aggregate annual subscription Fees paid under the Contract by the Customer to MOBU Technologies during the past twelve (12) months prior to the act or omission giving rise to the claim(s). Until twelve months has elapsed, the limitation of liability shall be calculated as the agreed annual subscription Fees for the first twelve (12) months after the Subscription Effective Date (based on the agreed number of licenses at the time of the Subscription Effective Date) multiplied by 0.5. This limitation of liability is cumulative and not per incident (i.e. the existence of two or more claims will not enlarge this limit)
14.5 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Contract, MOBU Technologies’ liability to the Customer:
a. for death or personal injury caused by the negligence of MOBU Technologies, its employees or sub-contractors; and
b. for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, is not limited, but nothing in this clause 14 confers any right or remedy upon the Customer to which it would not otherwise be entitled.
14.6 Without prejudice to clause 10.2, MOBU Technologies is not responsible for any errors or problems of any nature arising from the use of the Software for purposes for which it was not designed.
14.7 Subject to clauses 14.5 and 17.2, MOBU Technologies will not be liable to the Customer for any damage to, loss of or costs in respect of time spent by Customer’s employees or consultants in connection with the Software and Services (in each case, whether direct or indirect or suffered by End Users).
14.8 Nothing in clause 14 shall be construed to limit MOBU Technologies’ liability under mandatory law, including e.g. (i) MOBU Technologies’ liability in cases where it is documented that MOBU Technologies has acted in a grossly negligent or intentional manner, or (ii) provisions of applicable product liability law. Any product liability is, however, disclaimed to the furthest extent possible.
14.9 This clause 14 will continue in force after termination of the Contract for whatever reason.
<h6>Confidentiality</h6>
15.1 The Parties acknowledge and confirm that during the Term of the Contract and forever following its expiry they shall keep Confidential Information of the other Party strictly confidential and secret, i.e. neither Party may use or disclose to any third party (nor permit its use or disclosure) any Confidential Information of the other Party, unless specifically set forth in the Contract or as contemplated for the proper use of the Software.
15.2 The obligation of confidentiality set forth in clause 15 shall not apply to (i) information which is or becomes publicly known (through no fault or breach of the receiving Party), and (ii) if either Party is required by law or by any statutory or regulatory authority to which it is subject to disclose any Confidential Information, then it shall be entitled to do so provided that it (a) to the extent allowed, promptly notifies the other Party in writing of the full circumstances of the required disclosure, (b) consults with the other Party as to steps to minimise or avoid the disclosure and takes any such steps reasonably required by that other Party, and (c) to the extent possible, receives confidentiality undertakings in a form approved by the other Party from the entity to whom the Confidential Information is disclosed.

Customer Data.
In the event of any loss or damage to Customer Data, the Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy shall be for MOBU Technologies to use reasonable commercial endeavours to restore the lost or damaged Customer Data from the latest back-up of such Customer Data maintained by (i) MOBU Technologies to the extent that such Customer Data is held by MOBU Technologies through the provision of Services; and/or (ii) the Customer in all other circumstances. MOBU Technologies shall not be required to restore more than one previous full iteration of the Software and/or data containing the relevant lost or damaged Customer Data and shall not be required to restore one or more individual lost or damaged files.
17.2 MOBU Technologies shall however not be responsible for any loss, destruction, alteration or disclosure of Customer Data caused by any third party (except those third parties sub-contracted by MOBU Technologies to perform services related to Customer Data maintenance and back-up).
